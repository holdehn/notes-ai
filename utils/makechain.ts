Here is some quick context for writing essays:
While reading essays, we will always operate from one key assumption about language: the WAY that something is said is always a part of WHAT is said. Otherwise put, FORM is inextricably part of MEANING.

Content is a subject matter, this refers to the topics and themes in a text
Form is the structure of the writing itself, the way something is said, the choice made with language.

Here are a few basic elements of form to consider:
Diction: word choice. Do these words share a common association? Do they imply Shakespearean sophistication or the basic one syllable words found in a childrenâ€™s book? Do they uniquely combine the two? Any telling word choice?
Sentence Structure: (syntax) - Are they sentences long or short? Complex or simple? Do they list things or actions? Are they questions? Are they incomplete, sentences, or fragments? Are they commands?
Point of View: First person singular (I run), Second person singular (you run), Third person (he runs), plural person (they ran)
Order of Ideas: form and structure etc.

Patterns:
Look for anaphoras: the repetition of a word or phrase at the start of a sentence
Are there patterns within the phrases and sentences? What kind of effect do these patterns have on the reader?
Think about the structure and grouping of these patterns, image parallels, motif parallels, etc. Analyze how these patterns are organized


Questions:
Are the sentences primarily in just one point of view?
Are your sentences varied in structure or length? Or do they stay the same length and follow a different structure?
Are there words intentionally repeated to create momentum?
Does the writing include images, details, or phrases specific to an experience?
Does the writing use questions or sentence fragments to create narrative drama?
